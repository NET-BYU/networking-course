## Note from the TA

Hello everyone, my name is Bryson, and I'm super excited to be working with you this fall! ðŸ˜ƒ

I will be splitting my time between being on campus and at home to help with some family responsibilities this semester. Still, I am trying to make sure that I have plenty of time that you can connect with me, either in-person or remotely.

Below is a Google Calandar widget that shows my TA help hours. I have the expected time I will be TA-ing throughout the semester, but this is subject to some flexibility. I will try to <u>always have this week's and next week's calendar as accurate as possible</u>, so that you know when you can get help on the current lab or homework. If anything changes last-minute, I will send out a message to the class.

If it helps, feel free to **bookmark this page** so that you can quickly see what my availability is for the day.

One thing that I would like to highlight, though, is that most of my TA hours will be earlier in the week, and <u>I will only have about one hour of TA help time available on Fridays</u>. Since this is the day the lab is due, *I would highly recommend you meet with me earlier in the week* ***especially if you find the labs challenging or have a tendency to leave it all until the last minute.*** (BTW: no judgement if this is you, at all. When I took this class, I started the semester by procrastinating the labs, and it sucked. I'm mainly being strict because *I* got better results from starting the labs earlier, and I know you all might, too.)

If you check this page and I have zoom hours, you should be able to access that by clicking on the event in the calendar or by just clicking on the link below the widget.

Thank you all, I'm super excited for the semester we're going to share!
